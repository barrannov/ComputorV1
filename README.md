# ComputorV1

UNIT Factory project: ComputorV1

## Objective
Create a polynomial equation resolver (up to the 2nd grade). The resolver must at first reduce the equation to it's basic form, then it has to find the solution(s) and display them.

## Usage
$> python computor.py [option] "polinomial equation"

e.g: $>python ComputorV1.py "5 + 3X + 3 * X^2 = X^2 + 0 * X"
